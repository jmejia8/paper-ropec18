% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use

% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}

% The abstract
\begin{abstract}
This paper presents the application of a physics-inspired algorithm based on the 
center of mass concept, called Bilevel Centers Algorithm (BCA), to deal with 
bilevel optimization problems. The center of mass is adopted for creating new directions 
in the continuous search space considering the objective function values of a set 
of randomly-chosen solutions in a hierarchical structure. The performance of this
approach is assessed by using representative test function for bilevel optimization.
The obtained results are compared against the competitive algorithm BLEAQ.  The
results obtained are promising.

\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

A new kind of optimization problems are taking interest by researchers.
Those new problems where introduced in 1934 by Von Stackelberg in \cite{von2010market} 
and actually is called Bilevel Optimization (BO) . A BO problem is an optimization
problem (constrained and/or multi-objective and/or discrete, etc.) that contains
a nested optimization problem \cite{bard2013practical,dempe2002foundations}.
Note the hierarchal structure introduced which can be useful to model decision-making
processes, where a leader (upper level authority) optimize their goals restricted to
optimal decisions/solution given by a follower (lower level authority)
\cite{brotcorne2001bilevel,kalashnikov2010comparison,sinha2015transportation,von1945theory,wang2014bilevel}.

In order to formally introduce BO problems, we start describing optimization problems.
It is well known that an optimization problems can be represented as finding the set:
% 
\begin{align}
    \label{eqn:Xargmin}
    X^* &= \arg \min_{\vec{x} \in X} f(\vec{x}) \\ \nonumber
    &= \{ \vec{x}^* \in X \ : \ f(\vec{x}^*) \leq f( \vec{x} ), \ 
    % 
    \forall
    % 
    \vec{x} \in X \},
\end{align}
% 
where $f$ is bounded below function, i.e., $f(x^*) > -\infty$. $f$ is called objective
function. $X$ is a $D$-dimensional space of parameters, usually $X \subset \mathbb{R}^D$
is the domain for $\vec{x}$ representing constraints on allowable values for $\vec{x}$.
Equation \ref{eqn:Xargmin} may be read as: $X^*$ is the set of values (arguments)
$\vec{x} = \vec{x}^*$ that minimize $f(\vec{x})$ subject to $X^*$ (see Figure \ref{fig:single-level}).

% 
\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{img/monolevel.pdf}
    \caption{Single-objective optimization problem.}
    \label{fig:single-level}
\end{figure}

An optimization problem is solved only when a global minimum
is found. However, global minimum are, in general, difficult to find. Therefore,
in practice, we often have to find at least a local minimum \cite{rao2009engineering,back}.


Now, we can define a general BO problem with single-objective functions at both
levels can be defined as follows \cite{bard2013practical,dempe2002foundations}:

\noindent
Minimize
\begin{equation}
    F(x,\ y) \ \ x \in X , \ y \in Y 
    \label{eqn:minF1}
\end{equation}
% 
subject to:
% 
\begin{align}
    \label{eqn:y-arg}
    &y \in \arg \min \{ f(x, y) \ : \ g_j(x, y) \leq 0, \ j = 1,\ldots, J \}\\
    &G_k(x, y)  \leq 0, \ k = 1,\ldots,K
    \label{eqn:G}
\end{align}
where $F: X \times Y \to \mathbb{R}$ y $f: X \times Y \to \mathbb{R}$
are the upper-level objective function (leader) and lower-level objective function
(follower), respectively. In this work, $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ and
$Y \subseteq \mathbb{R}^m$ is considered. The Figure \ref{fig:bilevel} shows a
schematic diagram of a bilevel optimization problem.
% 
\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{img/bilevel.pdf}
    \caption{Diagram of a bilevel optimization problem. Here, $y^*$ 
            is defined as in Eq. (\ref{eqn:y-arg}). Note that $(x,\ y^*)$
            is a feasible solution.}
    \label{fig:bilevel}
\end{figure}

In 1992, Hansen et al. probed that BO problems are (strongly) NP-hard since for
evaluating a solution in the simplest BO problem (unimodal linear programming at
both levels) is also NP-hard \cite{hansen1992new,vicente1994descent}. Many real
world-problems can be naturally transformed into  BO problems \cite{sinha2018review},
for example: taxation, border security problems, transportation problems, among
others \cite{arroyo2010bilevel,bard2013practical,sinha2018review}.

Due to the importance of BO, many authors have proposed different kind of solutions
for those problems e.g. mathematical approaches (mathematical programming,
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker condition for single-level reduction) \cite{shi2005extended,dempe2002foundations},
evolutionary computation (genetic algorithms, evolution strategy, particle swarm
optimization, etc.) \cite{derrac2011practical,angelo2013differential,sinha2012unconstrained}.
In order to handle BO problems, there exist principally three strategies: nested,
single-level reduction and penalty methods. Nested strategies can be effective but
computationally very expensive when objective functions are computationally
expensive or high-dimensionality is present. Single-level reduction is used to
transform a BO problem into a single-level problem, usually via Karush-Kuhn-Tucker
conditions for smooth lower level objective function; as we can see, this strategy
is restricted for differentiable functions \cite{dempe2002foundations,colson2007overview}.
Penalty methods transform a constrained method into unconstrained adding some
penalties controlled by using parameters; this strategy can be simple for understanding
but hard to calibrate in large-scale problems \cite{savard1994steepest,white1993penalty}.

As mentioned, some algorithms for BO are reported in the specialized literature,
actually they are focused on evolutionary computation, since those algorithms have
been successfully used to solve single-level optimization problems, however the
complexity time increases considerably when they are applied to BO problems. On
the other hand, physics-inspired inspired algorithms have been successful used
for solving single-level optimization problems. Although, they are not as popular
as the evolutionary algorithms; physics-inspired algorithms can show good performance
and it can be interesting study it performance in BO problems. On the other hand,
no physics-inspired algorithms for BO are reported in the state-of-the-art. In this
paper we present a preliminary version of a physics-inspired algorithm for BO. Here,
unconstrained nested scheme is considered.

Our approach is called Bilevel Centers Algorithm (BCA) and is based on the center
of mass concept. Without loss of generality, we assume a maximization problem for
non-negative functions $f$ and $F$. The center of mass is used in both levels, in
order to create new biased directions towards promising/feasible regions in the
search space.


This paper is organized as follows: The next section presents the lower level
optimizer which uses the center of mass concept to promote a biased search to
promising search space regions. Our approach is presented in the
Section \ref{sec:ll-optimizer}. Section \ref{sec:experiments} gives some experiments
and discussion about BCA performance. Conclusions and Future work are described
in Section \ref{sec:conclu}  and Section \ref{sec:future}, respectively.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Lower Level Optimizer} % (fold)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{sec:ll-optimizer}

The center of mass is the unique point $\vec{c}$ at the center of a distribution
of mass $U = \{\vec{u}_1,\; \vec{u}_2 , \ldots , \vec{u}_K \}$ in a space that 
has the property that the weighted sum of position vectors relative to this
point is zero. That is:

\begin{equation}
    \sum_{i = 1}^K m(\vec{u}_i) (\vec{u}_i - \vec{c}) = 0,  \text{ implies } 
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \vec{c} = \dfrac{1}{M} \sum_{i = 1}^K  m(\vec{u}_i)  \vec{u}_i,
    \label{eqn:masscenter}
\end{equation}
%
%
where $m(\vec{u}_i)$ is the mass of $\vec{u}_i$ and  $M$ is the sum of the 
masses of vectors in $U$. Here, $m$ is a non-negative function.
 
Thus, the lower level optimizer works as follows: for each solution $\vec{y}_i $
in the population $P = \{ \vec{y}_1,\ \vec{y}_2, \ \ldots, \ \vec{y}_{N} \} $
of $N$  solutions in $Y$, we generate $U_i \subset P $ with $K$ \textbf{different}
solutions such that
% 
$$
\bigcup_{i=1}^N U_i = P.
$$
%
Next, from $U_i$ the center of mass $\vec{c}_i$ is computed by using the
Equation \ref{eqn:masscenter} by setting $m(\vec{u}) = f(\vec{x}, \vec{u})$ where
$\vec{x}$ is fixed. After that, \textbf{the worst element} $\vec{u}_{\text{worst}}$
in $U_i$ is selected according to the following rule:
% 
$$
    \vec{u}_{\text{worst}} \in \arg \min \{f(\vec{x}, \ \vec{u} ) 
    % 
    \ : \
    % 
    \vec{u} \in U_i \}.
$$
% 
Now, we are able to generate a direction to locate a new solution $ \vec{y}_i$
using the already generated center of mass $\vec{c}_i$, $\vec{y}_i$ and $\vec{u}_{\text{worst}}$.
% 
\begin{equation}
    \vec{q}_i = \vec{y}_i + \eta _{i} ( \vec{c}_i - \vec{u}_{ \text{worst} } ) ,
    \label{eqn:vcu2}
\end{equation}
% 

Due to this stochastic strategy, this variation operator can help the exploration
process to avoid premature convergence and it is capable to exploit the vicinity
near the best solution found. The replacement operator works as follows, if $\vec{q}_i$
is better than $\vec{y}_i$, then the worst element in $P$ is replaced by $\vec{q}$.

\begin{algorithm}[b]
    \caption{Lower Level Optimizer pseudocode}
    \label{alg:ll-optimizer}
    \begin{algorithmic}[1]
        \REQUIRE {upper level parameter $\vec{p}$, $K = 7, \; \eta_{\max} = 2$}
        \STATE $N \gets K*D$
        \STATE Initialize a population $P \subset Y$ with $N$ elements
        \WHILE{the end criterion is not achieved}
            \FOR {each $\vec{y}$ in $P$}
                \STATE Generate a subset $U \subset P$ with $K$ solutions
                \STATE Calculate $\vec{c}$ using $U$ with (\ref{eqn:masscenter})
                \STATE $\eta \gets \text{rand}(0,\; \eta_{\max}) $ 
                \STATE Compute $\vec{q}$ using Eq. (\ref{eqn:vcu2})
                % 
                \IF{$ f (\vec{p},\ \vec{y}) < f (\vec{p}, \ \vec{q})  $}
                    \STATE Replace worst element in $P$ with $\vec{q}$
                \ENDIF
                % 
            \ENDFOR
            % 
            \STATE Resize $P$ if necessary.
        \ENDWHILE
        \RETURN {the best solution in $P$}
    \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Optionally, a linear reduction of the population (deleting the worst elements) can
be applied. The initial population size is $ N(0) = K*D$ and the final population
size $N(T) =  2*K$ (for successfully generating the center of mass). Thus, the
population size over time is:
\begin{align}
    N(t) &= KD - \dfrac{(KD - 2K)  t}{T} \\ \nonumber
         &= K \left( D - \dfrac{(D - 2)  t}{T} \right),
\end{align}
% 
where $t = 0,1,2,\ldots,T$ and $T$ is the maximum number of iterations.

The procedure for the implementation of the lower level optimizer is detailed in
Algorithm \ref{alg:ll-optimizer}.

\section{BCA} % (fold)
\label{sec:bca}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Here, BCA is presented as the upper lower optimizer. We start describing the
variation operator of BCA which is considering some properties. Let $F$ and $f$
defined as in (\ref{eqn:minF1})-(\ref{eqn:G}), and without lost of generality, we
can assume that both $F$ and $f$ are non-negative and we want to maximize them.
Hence, the population for a BO problem can be defined as follows: 
$$
    P = \{ (\vec{x}_1,\; \vec{y}_1), \ (\vec{x}_2,\; \vec{y}_2), \ldots,
           (\vec{x}_N,\; \vec{y}_N)
         \}
         \subset X \times Y,
$$
where $\vec{y}_i \in \arg \min \{ f(\vec{x}_i, \ \vec{z}) \ : \ \vec{z} \in Y \}$
for $i = 1,\ldots,N$. Here, $\vec{x}_i$ is uniformly at random.
% 

\subsection{Algorithm Description} % (fold)
\label{sub:algorithm_description}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{img/bca-ul.pdf}
    \caption{Diagram of BCA. Here, $x_1,\ldots,x_K$ are used to compute better
    upper level parameters $\vec{p}$. Note that $(x_i,\ y_i^*)$ and
    $(\vec{p},\ \vec{q})$ are feasible solution.}
    \label{fig:bca-diag}
\end{figure}

Now, we are able to describe the BCA procedure: For each iteration and each
solution $(\vec{x}_i,\; \vec{y}_i) \in P$, a new upper level parameter is generated
using the following formulation:
% 
\begin{equation}
    \vec{p}_i =  \vec{x}_i + \eta _{i} ( \vec{c}_i - \vec{u}_{ \text{worst} } ),
    \label{eqn:vcu2F}
\end{equation}
% 
%
where the $\vec{c}_i$ is the center of mass is computed using:
%
\begin{equation}
    \vec{c}_i = \dfrac{1} {W} \sum_{(x,y) \in U} Q(\vec{x},\ \vec{y}) \cdot \vec{x} , 
            \hspace{0.5cm} 
            W = \sum_{ (x,y) \in U} Q(\vec{x},\ \vec{y}),
            % \hspace{0.5cm} 
            % U \subseteq P.
    \label{eqn:centerF}
\end{equation} 
% 
where $Q(\vec{x},\ \vec{y}) = F(\vec{x},\ \vec{y}) + f(\vec{x},\ \vec{y})$, $U \subset P $
such that card$(U) = K$  and $\vec{u}_{ \text{worst}}$ is the first coordinate of
the worst element in $U$, i.e.

$$
    \vec{u}_{\text{worst}} \in \arg \min \{F(\vec{u}, \ \vec{y} ) 
    % 
    \ : \
    % 
    \vec{u} \in U_i \}.
$$
% 
Note that the function $Q(\vec{x},\ \vec{y})$ is used to translate the upper level
population towards regions where $F$ and $f$ are maximized simultaneously.

Finally, the new solution is given by $ (\vec{p}, \ \vec{q}) $ which may 
replace the worst solution in $ P $ if it is better than $(\vec{x}_i,\; \vec{y}_i)$. Here,
$  \vec{q} = \arg \min _ {\vec{z} \in Y} f (\vec{p}, \ \vec{z}) $ obtained
by applying the Algorithm \ref{alg:ll-optimizer}. Figure \ref{fig:bca-diag}
shows a representation of BCA solution update. 

BCA is summarized in Algorithm \ref{alg:BCA} and was used to carried out some
experiments by using eight representative test functions for bilevel optimization
(SMD problems) which are described in \cite{angelo2013differential,sinha2012unconstrained}.
This empirical study is used to quantify the efficiency of BCA and how it is
positioned with respect to algorithms of the state-of-the-art.

\section{Experiments and Discussion}
\label{sec:experiments}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

BCA was used to solve some representative test functions described in
\cite{sinha2012unconstrained,sinha2014test}. The configuration was:
% 
% 
The number of Function Evaluations (NFEs) were fixed for the upper level ($500D_{UL} = 2500$)
and the lower level ($500D_{UL}*500D_{LL} = 6,250,000$).

\begin{itemize}
    \item Upper level dimension $D_{UL} = 5$
    \item Lower level dimension $D_{LL} = 5$
    \item Upper level population size $K*D_{UL}$
    \item Lower level population size $K*D_{LL}$
    \item $K = 7$
    \item $\eta_{\max} = 2$
    \item Stop condition: BCA stopped when the accuracy ($1\times 10^{-4}$) or
    the maximum NFEs allowed was reached.
\end{itemize}


BCA was compared against BLEAQ which is an evolutionary algorithm for BO problems
\cite{sinha2013efficient,sinha2018review}. BLEAQ is based on quadratic approximations
of optimal lower level variables with respect to the upper level variables to reduce
the NFES with competitive results. Both algorithms were used to solve independently
31 time each test problem.

Tables \ref{tab:ul-accuracy} and \ref{tab:ll-accuracy} shows the statistics
obtained from the accuracy obtained in the two levels. The best, median, mean,
worst and std. deviation function evaluations required to solve the respective
problem using BCA is given in Table \ref{tab:ul-fes} and \ref{tab:ll-fes} for
each level, respectively. Tables \ref{tab:ul-comparative-fes} and \ref{tab:ul-comparative-fes}
compares the median accuracy and NFEs at the upper and lower levels required by
BCA against that required by BLEAQ. Note that, a result in \textbf{boldface} indicates
the best values found.


It can be observed that both BCA and BLEAQ obtained similar results at median,
nevertheless BCA require less function evaluations for most of the test problems
at upper level; this is an interesting property, since we can propose a mathematical
methodology in order to decrease than number of function evaluations at lower level,
since the experiments shows an huge number of evaluations are required at this level.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclu}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This work detailed a physics-inspired algorithm based on center of mass for bilevel
optimization. Eight test functions for bilevel optimization were employed in order
to analyze the performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of accuracy and
upper/lower level function evaluations.

Additionally, the results showed that BCA was able to provide competitive
results (in terms of accuracy) compared to an efficient algorithm.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future}

The future paths of research are the following: Make a mathematical study  in
order to approximate feasible solutions at lower level and decrease number of
evaluations required at this level; adapt some penalty methods to transform the
nested scheme into a single level optimization problem; also, constraint-handling
techniques will be explored to scale BCA.
